    "# Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The AlzAware project aims to develop a predictive model for early identification of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and Alzheimer’s Disease-Related Dementias (AD/ADRD) based on social determinants of health. Utilizing data from the Mexican Health and Aging Study (MHAS), this project focuses on uncovering associations between social, economic, and environmental factors and cognitive decline risk. The ultimate goal is to enable early intervention and improved access to care, especially for underrepresented populations.\n",
    "Background:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Alzheimer’s Disease affects more than 6 million Americans, with numbers expected to increase as the population ages. Current diagnostic methods for AD and related dementias are often insufficient for detecting early stages, particularly among underserved communities. Social determinants of health, such as socioeconomic status, education, and healthcare access, play a significant role in health outcomes but are often overlooked in cognitive health assessments. This project seeks to leverage these factors to predict cognitive decline and provide earlier, more accessible insights into potential AD/ADRD development.\n",
    "Data Source:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The dataset used in this project is derived from the Mexican Health and Aging Study (MHAS), a longitudinal survey of adults over 50 in Mexico. The dataset includes comprehensive information on demographics, economic circumstances, health, and lifestyle behaviors, spanning multiple survey years. Using historical data from 2003 and 2012 as predictive factors, the model will forecast cognitive health scores for 2016 and 2021.\n",
    "Methodology:\n",
    "\n",
    "* This project follows the CRISP-DM methodology, ensuring a structured approach to data science:\n",
    "    - Business Understanding: Define objectives, goals, and success metrics.\n",
    "    - Data Understanding: Explore data sources, understand data structures, and identify relevant variables.\n",
    "    - Data Preparation: Process, clean, and structure data for modeling.\n",
    "    - Modeling: Build and optimize predictive models to estimate cognitive scores.\n",
    "    - Evaluation: Validate model performance, assessing metrics such as RMSE and bias across demographics.\n",
    "    - Deployment: Plan for model integration into clinical or public health systems, focusing on interpretability and usability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Goals and Outcomes:\n",
    "* Improved Early Detection: Identify individuals at risk of AD/ADRD based on non-clinical factors, enabling timely intervention.\n",
    "* Bias Mitigation: Ensure the model provides accurate predictions across diverse demographics, minimizing disparities.\n",
    "* Enhanced Accessibility: Develop a model that can be applied broadly, requiring only widely available social health data.\n",
    "* Potential for Generalization: Provide a framework that can be adapted for AD/ADRD prediction in other populations and regions."

    "\n",
    "* The submission_format dataset has three columns: uid, year, and composite_score.\n",
    "* Each row represents a unique individual (uid) for a specific year, with composite_score currently set to 0.\n",
    "* This format suggests the expected structure for submission, likely requiring predicted values for composite_score.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Test and Train Features**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Both test_features and train_features datasets contain numerous columns (184 in total), mostly focused on social, demographic, and health-related factors.\n",
    "* Columns include identifiers like uid, categories like age_03, urban_03, and responses to social and health questions (married_03, n_mar_03, etc.).\n",
    "* Many fields have missing values, as indicated by NaN, and categorical data encoded with prefixes like 1., 2., which may require preprocessing to make values numeric or otherwise usable in modeling.\n",

    "**Challenges**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The categorical values include descriptions (e.g., 1. Married or in civil union) that may need to be cleaned and converted to numeric codes.\n",
    "* Some columns have complex string representations (e.g., rrelgimp_12 shows responses like \"1.very important\"), suggesting the need for encoding or label transformation.\n",

    "**Potential Focus Areas for Preprocessing**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data Cleaning: Removing numerical prefixes from categorical responses (e.g., transforming 1. 50–59 to 50–59).\n",
    "* Encoding: Converting categorical variables into numerical form through techniques such as label encoding or one-hot encoding.\n",
    "* Handling Missing Values: Filling in missing values based on specific imputation strategies or removing rows/columns if appropriate.\n",
    "* Feature Selection: Since there are 184 features, exploring dimensionality reduction techniques might improve model performance and interpretability."

    "* The data shows consistent cardinality across train and test datasets, which suggests similar categorical diversity across the datasets and time periods. This consistency in cardinality is beneficial for model training as it indicates similar feature distributions between the train and test sets, reducing the risk of distributional shifts. These categorical levels can be used for one-hot encoding or other categorical transformations during preprocessing."

    "##### Observations\n",
    "* Distribution of composite_score for 2016 and 2021:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The composite_score distributions for both 2016 and 2021 appear to follow a similar bell-shaped curve, though there is a noticeable increase in the distribution for 2021.\n",
    "    - Both distributions show a concentration of scores between 100 and 200, indicating this is the most common range for cognitive function scores in the data.\n",
    "    - There is a slight positive skew, suggesting that fewer individuals have high cognitive scores, with most falling in the lower to mid ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Correlation Matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The correlation matrix highlights a strong positive correlation between hincome_12 (household income), hinc_business_12 (household business income), and hinc_rent_12 (household rental income). This suggests that individuals with high household income tend to have higher income from business and rental sources as well.\n",
    "    - The composite_score has a weak positive correlation with hincome_12, hinc_business_12, and hinc_rent_12, indicating that household income factors are not strong predictors of cognitive scores in this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Scatter Plot Matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The scatter plot matrix shows relationships between hincome_12, hinc_business_12, hinc_rent_12, and composite_score.\n",
    "    - The plots show outliers, especially in the income-related features (hincome_12, hinc_business_12, and hinc_rent_12), with a few extremely high values.\n",
    "    - Most data points are clustered around lower income values, with a wide distribution of composite_score values for these individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Univariate Distribution of Income Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The income features (hincome_12, hinc_business_12, hinc_rent_12) display a high concentration of values close to zero, with a few outliers significantly higher than the main distribution.\n",
    "    - The Box plots reveal extreme values in all three income-related features, suggesting the presence of outliers that may impact model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Target Distribution: The composite_score distributions are positively skewed with a higher frequency of scores in the mid-range (100-200), which may affect model performance if not accounted for.\n",
    "* Income-Related Variables: Although income-related features are correlated with each other, they show little correlation with composite_score, implying limited predictive power for cognitive function scores.\n",
    "* Outliers: The presence of outliers, especially in income-related features, suggests the need for preprocessing steps, such as scaling or removing outliers, to improve model performance.\n"

    "##### Observations\n",
    "* Longitudinal Patterns\n",
    "    - Health and Activity Levels: Across the key adl (Activities of Daily Living) scores for 2003 and 2012, the distributions indicate very low values with some minor right skew. This suggests that a large portion of the participants had low activity limitations in both years.\n",
    "    - Global Health (glob_hlth): There is limited variance in global health scores across the years 2003 and 2012. The distributions are centered around low scores, indicating a high concentration of individuals reporting fewer health issues, though mean values slightly change across time points.\n",
    "    - Subtle Shifts Over Time: For certain variables like adl_dress, adl_walk, adl_toilet, and adl_eat, there is a slight increase in mean scores from 2003 to 2012. This could reflect aging effects, where individuals report slightly more difficulties in performing daily activities as time progresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Trend Analysis\n",
    "    - Mean Comparisons: In the bar chart comparing mean values of key indicators, there is a notable rise in values for indicators like adl_dress and adl_walk over time, suggesting an increase in activity limitations from 2003 to 2012.\n",
    "    - Box Plots for Year Comparisons: The box plots for each indicator (e.g., adl_dress, adl_walk) show a similar trend with minor shifts in the distributions. These visualizations provide further evidence of subtle increases in limitations over time, which align with expected aging-related declines.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Derived Insights\n",
    "    - Feature Engineering: Given the changes observed, it may be useful to engineer new features capturing the differences between 2003 and 2012 for each indicator. This could enhance predictive power by highlighting temporal changes.\n",
    "    - Further Analysis: Additional statistical tests could be conducted to confirm if these temporal shifts are statistically significant. This would help verify if the observed changes are meaningful for modeling purposes."

    "##### Observations\n",
    "**Demographic Distribution**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Age\n",
    "    - In 2003, most individuals were in the age group of 50–59, followed by 60–69. Very few individuals were aged 80+ or 49 or younger.\n",
    "    - By 2012, the distribution shifted slightly, with the 60–69 group being the largest, while the 80+ and 49 or younger groups remained underrepresented.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Education\n",
    "    - In both 2003 and 2012, a significant portion of the population fell into the \"1–5 years\" education category, with \"6 years\" and \"no education\" also prevalent. Higher education levels (10+ years) were underrepresented in both years.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Urban/Rural\n",
    "    - In 2003, the majority lived in urban areas (100,000+ population), with rural areas (<100,000) being underrepresented.\n",
    "    - This trend slightly reversed in 2012, with the urban-rural distribution becoming more balanced, though urban areas remained somewhat dominant.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Potential Bias in Features**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Socioeconomic Factors\n",
    "    - Income distributions (household, business, and rental) for 2012 show a highly skewed distribution, with most values concentrated at lower income levels and a few very high outliers. This skew could indicate socioeconomic disparities, where the majority have limited income, and a few individuals or families have significantly higher income levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Urban vs. Rural Distribution:\n",
    "    - The imbalance between urban and rural areas in both years could suggest a potential bias favoring urban populations. This may affect the model's generalization to rural populations if not adequately addressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Handling Underrepresented Groups**\n",
    "\n",
    "*    Age Groups\n",
    "    - Certain age groups (49 or younger, 70–79, and 80+) are consistently underrepresented. This could lead to a model that may not perform as well for younger or older individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Education Levels\n",
    "Higher education levels (10+ years) and some middle education levels (6–9 years) are also underrepresented, which may affect the model’s accuracy across different education backgrounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Rural Populations \n",
    "The rural (<100,000 population) demographic is underrepresented, especially in 2003. Special attention may be needed to ensure the model doesn’t bias predictions toward urban characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The distribution shows that most individuals are middle-aged, have low to moderate levels of education, and predominantly reside in urban areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Income data is highly skewed, indicating significant income inequality, which could introduce bias if not handled appropriately. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a need to consider strategies like resampling or applying weights to address the potential underrepresentation of certain groups, especially for age, rural populations, and education levels, to enhance model fairness and ensure equitable predictions across different demographics."

    "### Conclusion - Data Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Completeness and Quality**\n",
    "\n",
    "- While the train and submission data are mostly complete, the test features data contains a considerable amount of missing values, particularly in certain attributes (e.g., a16a_12, a22_12). \n",
    "- This will require specific handling strategies such as imputation or exclusion of high-missing-value columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature Diversity and Cardinality**\n",
    "- The data contains a variety of features, including demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related attributes. \n",
    "- Many categorical features exhibit consistent cardinality across years (e.g., marital status, education level), which suggests stable data categories that are suitable for encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Outliers** \n",
    "- Income-related variables show significant outliers, which could impact model performance. These outliers will need careful treatment, potentially through transformation, removal, or scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Temporal Analysis** \n",
    "-   Longitudinal changes are observed in health and socioeconomic indicators between 2003 and 2012, which might be relevant for trend-based feature engineering and temporal pattern analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bias and Representation** \n",
    "- Certain demographics, such as age groups (49 or younger, 80+), rural populations, and specific education levels, are underrepresented. \n",
    "- This may introduce bias, especially if the model does not account for these distributions."

    "The use of polynomial features combined with Lasso regression provided better performance (lower RMSE) than Ridge regression. The Lasso model's ability to perform feature selection by driving some coefficients to zero might have helped reduce noise in the polynomial feature space, resulting in better generalization. This outcome suggests that Lasso regression with polynomial features can be a good approach for capturing non-linear patterns while managing overfitting. "

    "The coefficients of the features in the Ridge Regression model are displayed, showing the importance and direction of each feature's effect on the target variable.\n",
    "Features with positive coefficients, such as rafeduc_m (5.4004) and rjlocc_m_12_encoded_freq (-4.0275), suggest that these features have a significant impact on the target variable, with positive coefficients indicating a direct relationship and negative coefficients an inverse relationship.\n",
    "Some features like urban (1.7542) and n_living_child (-1.0591) also have relatively large coefficients, indicating their importance in the model.\n",
    "Many features, especially those with smaller coefficients, have minimal impact on the prediction, suggesting they might be less critical for the model's output.\n",
    "Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Ridge Regression model's interpretability is enhanced by examining the feature coefficients, which indicate the strength and direction of each feature's influence on the target variable. Features with larger absolute values for coefficients are more influential, helping to understand key drivers in the data. This interpretability allows stakeholders to gain insights into which variables significantly impact the outcome, potentially guiding decision-making. The results also suggest that feature selection or dimensionality reduction could further optimize the model by removing low-impact features."

    "The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) library was used to interpret the Ridge Regression model, providing insights into feature importance and the impact of each feature on individual predictions.\n",
    "A SHAP summary plot was generated, which shows the SHAP values for the most impactful features on the model's output. The plot ranks features by importance based on their average absolute SHAP values.\n",
    "The top features with high SHAP impact include rameduc_m, rafeduc_m, age, rjlocc_m_12_encoded_freq, and edu_gru.\n",
    "Each dot represents a SHAP value for an individual prediction. The color gradient from blue to red indicates the feature value (low to high).\n",
    "Features like rameduc_m and rafeduc_m show substantial SHAP values, indicating a strong influence on the model output.\n",
    "Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "The SHAP analysis provides a clear view of the most influential features in the Ridge Regression model and the direction of their impact on predictions. Features such as rameduc_m and rafeduc_m are identified as key drivers, consistent with the model coefficients from Ridge Regression. The SHAP plot allows for deeper interpretability by highlighting how each feature's value (low vs. high) influences the model's predictions. This interpretability is valuable for understanding and explaining model behavior, especially for complex datasets with numerous features."

    "The Ridge Regression model's feature importance analysis highlights the most influential features, such as rameduc_m, age, edu_gru, rafeduc_m, and rjlocc_m_12_encoded_freq. These features have the most substantial impact on the target variable, either positively or negatively. Features with coefficients near zero, like certain uid features, contribute minimally and could be considered for removal or dimensionality reduction to streamline the model. This insight into feature importance aids in understanding the model's key drivers, facilitating interpretability and potential feature engineering for further optimization.\n",
    "* The feature importance analysis reveals that educational factors (e.g., rameduc_m, edu_gru, rafeduc_m) and age are the most significant predictors of the composite score. Educational variables have a strong positive impact, while age has a notable negative effect, suggesting an inverse relationship with the score. Many features have negligible influence, indicating that they might be candidates for removal to simplify the model without affecting its performance. This highlights that education and age are key drivers in predicting the outcome, with other features contributing minimally."
